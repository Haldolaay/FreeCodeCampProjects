  <p>
    “In that area, if you didn’t go to college, you basically had a choice of the oil fields or the military. The Army really suited him; he always had such robust energy and he always wanted to help people, and he felt he was doing that.”</p>

  <h3>Life and Death</h3>
  <p>Wheeler was born in Roland, Oklahoma. He graduated from Muldrow High School in Muldrow, Oklahoma in 1994. He was a citizen of the Cherokee Nation.</p>
  <p>Wheeler was killed in the predawn hours of 22 October 2015 during Operation Inherent Resolve as a result of enemy small-arms fire sustained during a raid on a ISIS prison compound 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) North of the town of Hawija in Iraq's Kirkuk province. He was one of around 30 U.S. special operations soldiers who fought alongside Kurdish Counter-terrorism unit peshmerga forces. The operation secured the release of approximately 70 hostages, including more than 20 members of the Iraqi Security Forces, being held in the compound. Wheeler was directing the Kurdish attack on the prison and joined the fighting when those who had breached the compound came under fire inside. Reports stated that Wheeler ran toward the sound of the gunfire and that his actions along with those of one of his teammates ensured the success of the operation and protected those Kurdish fighters who had breached the compound. The Kurdish Regional Government asked U.S. special operations forces to support an operation to free hostages that were being held inside the prison and were going to be executed. Information had been obtained which stated the hostages faced imminent execution and it was confirmed that graves had already been prepared for the hostages outside of the compound. The Kurdish Regional Government stated after the raid that none of the 15 Kurdish fighters who were the object of the operation were found and that none of the hostages freed were Kurdish. Four Kurdish peshmerga soldiers were wounded during the operation. Five ISIS militants were detained during the operation and approximately 20 were killed.</p>

  <h3>Baddass Stories</h3>
  <p>After graduating high school in 1995 Wheeler enlisted in the U.S. Army as an infantryman.  He became a certified Airborne jumpmaster, an expert marksman, and a master of small-unit tactics, heavy weapons, and other awesome stuff.  After just two years of service he passed Ranger School and qualified for one of the most elite units in the U.S. military – the 75th Ranger Regiment.  After serving as a Ranger for nearly a decade, Wheeler was recommended for the only possible upgrade – Delta Force.</p>

  <p>even though MSG Wheeler received the nation’s fourth-highest award for bravery an unbelievable ELEVEN TIMES, we may never see a single one of his citations.  He’s just that badass.  We know that Delta Force’s mission has been to hunt down terrorist leaders and capture or kill them behind enemy lines.  They tracked Al-Qaeda after 9/11.  They found Saddam Hussein.  They captured the guy behind the Benghazi attacks, wiped out an ISIS base in Syria, and once grabbed an Al-Qaeda leader right out his friggin’ apartment building in Libya. In May of this year they went into a base in Iraq and wiped out twelve members of ISIS’s high command without losing a single operative.  This is badass stuff.</p>
  <p>The clock had just clicked over to October 22, 2015, when the Black Hawks began unloading Delta Force and Peshmerga troops outside the ISIS prison.  The mission was clear – Peshmerga would go in, breach the walls with explosives, and break the prisoners out.  Delta was only there to provide a perimeter.  They were not supposed to engage.

Of course, as tends to happen, shit got messed up. 

Peshmerga demo guys got to the wall and detonated the charge, but it didn’t work.  They weren’t getting through the wall.  Time was of the essence – the ISIS guards had now been alerted, and it would be mere seconds before they’d set up a defensive perimeter and start capping hostages.  If something was going to be done, it needed to be done ASAP.

Despite orders not to engage, Master Sergeant Joshua Wheeler left his position and ran head-on into the battle.</p>

  <p>Under heavy enemy AK-47 fire, Wheeler calmly set up a breaching charge, stacked up his Delta troops, and blew the wall.  He charged in, guns blazing, but sadly was hit by a burst of enemy fire that was directed at the breach.  He became the first American soldier killed in the fight against ISIS in Iraq.

Behind him, the rest of the Peshmerga and Delta Force raced through the breaching hole, firing and blasting with rifles and grenades in every direction.  The assault operation was quick, vicious, and decisive.  In minutes, Allied troops had blitzed through the prison facility and taken it over, killing over twenty of the enemy, taking five ISIS fighters prisoner, and driving the enemy back with a hail of automatic weapons fire.  The rescuers reached the prison’s cell block under heavy fire, cut the gates open, and were shocked to find that instead of 20 Peshmerga fighters, the prison held nearly 80 people – most of them innocent Iraqi civilians.  All of the prisoners had been slated to be executed at dawn. 

The Black Hawks came under heavy ground fire as they evacuated the soldiers and hostages, but the only casualty was MSG Wheeler, a man who died a heroic death while saving the lives of 80 people from a gruesome execution.  He was brought back to the U.S. for burial on Sunday.

As the Black Hawks pulled away, a flight of F-15 Strike Eagles blew the prison apart with enough JDAM missiles to crater the earth. 

This is a helmet cam video that was released of the prisoners being rescued during the raid.  MSG Wheeler does not appear in it at all, but it’s an interesting insight to the twenty years this man spent fighting for what he believed was right.</p>
